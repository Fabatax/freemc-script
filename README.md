This is a FreeMC start.sh script used for bypassing some stuff
for example: waiting for players to join and cpu point limiter :P

Credits to TheAdminHammer (On youtube) and someone else in the FreeMC community for finding this bug/loophole

======================================
Usage:
Open 2 tabs of https://panel.freemc.host and go to your server (both tabs)
The first tab: You would want to open just the terminal/console
The second tab: you would want ton open file manager and open the file "start.sh"

in the second tab you would want to copy and paste the whole script of https://github.com/Fabatax/freemc-script/blob/main/start.sh
to the start.sh in your server

after that you HAVE to spam the "Save" button and then switch to the first tab and press "Start"
after pressing "Start" IMMEDIATELY go to the second tab and continue to spam the "Save" button fast
after around 5 seconds go to the first tab and check if theres a change to the Starting/Booting process of your server! :D
If there is then well done!
If there is no change then restart everything lmao
======================================

Don't do this often or there is a chance that you will get banned :P
